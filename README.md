# virtual-drawing-AI
Designed and implemented a Virtual Drawing System that allows users to draw on a screen in real-time using hand gestures without physically touching the device. The system uses computer vision and AI to track the userâ€™s hand or finger movement via webcam and translates these motions into on-screen drawings.

Leveraged Python along with OpenCV for real-time image processing and Mediapipe for hand-tracking. The system recognizes specific hand gestures (like pinching or pointing) to toggle between drawing, color selection, or clearing the canvas. This touchless interface provides an engaging and interactive experience, suitable for creative applications or accessibility tools.
